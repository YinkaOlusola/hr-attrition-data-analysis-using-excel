From the Dashboard shown above, it can be seen that attrition is higher among males than females.

Employees with Bachelor's degrees exhibited the highest attrition, which may be due to the fact that they are constantly looking around
for jobs that suit their needs and want. This is corroborated by the high attrition that can be observed by among the lowest age group among the employees.


It can be seen that among the different departments, Research and Development have the highest attrition, and this can be partly attributed by the constant investment
in R&D which is therefore constantly attracting young talents.
